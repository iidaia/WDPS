The second assignment does not have fixed goal. Instead, every group is free to pick a different task and work on it (with some obvious conditions). The assignment should be done in groups of four students. The deadline for submitting the assignment is 16/12/2020.

Instructions
The first thing that you have to do is to decide what you want to do. In principle, each topic presented in the course is a valid direction for the assignment. Some examples of projects that you can do are reported below:

You can work on better procedures for entity recognition
You can extend entity linking in several ways
Work on multi-lingual alignment (e.g., some entities might be available in French but not in English, etc.)
Focus on the case where entities are not in the KB
...
Perform relation extraction between entities
Try to determine the sentiment around some entities (are some entities described in a positive or negative way)
Identify whether some pages make conflicting statements
