The second assignment does not have fixed goal. Instead, every group is free to pick a different task and work on it (with some obvious conditions). The assignment should be done in groups of four students. The deadline for submitting the assignment is 16/12/2020.

Instructions
The first thing that you have to do is to decide what you want to do. In principle, each topic presented in the course is a valid direction for the assignment. Some examples of projects that you can do are reported below:

You can work on better procedures for entity recognition
You can extend entity linking in several ways
Work on multi-lingual alignment (e.g., some entities might be available in French but not in English, etc.)
Focus on the case where entities are not in the KB
...
Perform relation extraction between entities
Try to determine the sentiment around some entities (are some entities described in a positive or negative way)
Identify whether some pages make conflicting statements
...
The assignment should be challenging (you are a group of four students) but feasible (it should be done in about one month). I will schedule some meetings with all the groups in the coming days to discuss the content of each project. It is very important that you state very clearly what your goal is. I expect that you submit a small document (max 0.5 pages) where you describe:

What you want to do and what is the motivation behind it
What is the potential roadmap before the submission
What you expect to deliver by the deadline
How you plan to split the work between the group members
This document must be by Friday 20/11 via Canvas and must be approved by me.

For the final deadline (16/12), each group must submit (again using Canvas):

A video presentation of 10 minutes where all the group members describe the project and solution. The links will be posted on canvas and available to everyone.
A small report of 1-2 pages describing your solution, technical challenges and reporting some early results (if any)
Any code that you have produced during the development of the assignment.
